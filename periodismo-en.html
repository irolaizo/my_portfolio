  <h2>Francoism through cinema</h2>
  <p>
    This final project focuses on Francoism as portrayed in cinema. I chose this topic because it seemed especially relevant to analyze the changes that took place during the dictatorship.
  </p>
  <p>
    I approached the subject through media, particularly informative feature films. The core material for my study was the NO-DO newsreels — a key source for understanding the regime’s official narrative.
  </p>
  <p>
    The work focuses on the 1960s, a decade marked by significant social and economic changes. In this context, mass tourism emerged as a major force driving growth.
  </p>

  <h3>From the 60s to today</h3>
  <p>
    Today, tourism remains a growing industry. What was once a rare opportunity has become a part of daily life, shaping the way we relate to the world.

  <p>
    Through family stories, we can reconstruct how that transition was experienced — from spontaneous trips to the first vacation memories.
